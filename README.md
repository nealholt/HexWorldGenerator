# HexWorldGenerator

Run main.py

There are lots of parameters you can fiddle with in constants.py
The workhorse functions for map generating are in map_generation.py 
functions.py has some nice utilities for things like accessing neighboring cells.

I don't own any of the images. They come from here:

Though I added some roads that were missing and changed the background to black because it fixed a transparency issue I was having.
